  1. If you are absent, you will receive 0 points for participation, only a medical excuse from the university constitutes as an excused absence.
  2. If you are present, but non-participatory you will receive 0 points for participation. 
  3. Participation is measured every class. You can lose up to 20 points for lack of participation.

**Exams**. Examinations measure not only your understanding of important course concepts, but your ability to apply, critique and evaluate them in new settings.

  2. Exams are issued in class, on paper.
  3. Exams are posted as scheduled; no make-ups are allowed so plan accordingly.

**IT Research Project**. The purpose of the research project is to demonstrate you can apply what you have learned in the course to make an informed decision about an IT product or service offering. You might be given a scenario or case study which frames which type of solution you should select, or you might be asked to craft your own business scenario. You will be evaluated based on your use of terminology learned in the course, application of relevant concepts to the problem at hand, research quality, and analysis of the solution. Things to consider: What is it? What does it do? Why is it valuable to an organization? What does it cost? How is it licensed? How is it implemented / deployed / hosted? What is required to use it? What are the TCO? ROI? Strengths / Weaknesses, etc.

  1. It is expected your presentation will be well researched with cited sources as the basis of information you provide. You should presume to know nothing about the subject and cite all facts from sources.
  2. This is a group assignment. 3-4 students per group. You must submit a student contribution report of who did what.

# University Policies

## Academic Integrity Policy

Syracuse University&#39;s academic integrity policy reflects the high value that we, as a university community, place on honesty in academic work. The policy in effect at the School of Information Studies defines our expectations for academic honesty and holds students accountable for the integrity of all work they submit. Students should understand that it is their responsibility to learn about course-specific expectations, as well as about university-wide academic integrity expectations. The pilot policy governs appropriate citation and use of sources, the integrity of work submitted in exams and assignments, and the veracity of signatures on attendance sheets and other verification of participation in class activities. The pilot policy also prohibits students from submitting the same work in more than one class without receiving written authorization in advance from both instructors. Under the pilot policy, students found in violation are subject to grade sanctions determined by the course instructor and non-grade sanctions determined by the School or College where the course is offered. SU students are required to read an online summary of the university&#39;s academic integrity expectations and provide an electronic signature agreeing to abide by them twice a year during pre-term check-in on MySlice. For more information and on the policy, see [http://academicintegrity.syr.edu](http://academicintegrity.syr.edu).

## Disability-Related Accommodations

Syracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to a climate of mutual respect and full participation. If you believe that you need accommodations for a disability, please contact the Office of Disability Services (ODS), http://disabilityservices.syr.edu, located at 804 University Avenue, room 309, or call 315.443.4498 for an appointment to discuss your needs and the process for requesting accommodations. ODS is responsible for coordinating disability-related accommodations and will issue &quot;Accommodation Authorization Letters&quot; to students as appropriate. Since accommodations may require early planning and generally are not provided retroactively, please contact ODS as soon as possible.  Our goal at the iSchool is to create learning environments that are useable, equitable, inclusive and welcoming. If there are aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in barriers to your inclusion or accurate assessment or achievement, please meet with me to discuss additional strategies beyond official accommodations that may be helpful to your success.

## Religious Observances Notification and Policy

SU&#39;s religious observances policy, found at http://supolicies.syr.edu/emp\_ben/religious\_observance.htm , recognizes the diversity of faiths represented in the campus community and protects the rights of students, faculty, and staff to observe religious holy days according to their tradition. Under the policy, students should have an opportunity to make up any examination, study, or work requirements that may be missed due to a religious observance provided they notify their instructors no later than the end of the second week of classes through an online notification form in MySlice listed under **Student Services/Enrollment/My Religious Observances/Add a Notification**.

## Student Academic Work Policy

Student work prepared for University courses in any media may be used for educational purposes, if the course syllabus makes clear that such use may occur. You grant permission to have your work used in this manner by registering for, and by continuing to be enrolled in, courses where such use of student work is announced in the course syllabus.

I may use academic work that you complete this semester in subsequent semesters for educational purposes. Before using your work for that purpose, I will either get your written permission or render the work anonymous by removing all your personal identification.

## Course Evaluations

There will be an end of course evaluation for you to complete this term, described below.  This evaluation will be conducted online and is entirely anonymous. You will receive a notification from the Syracuse University Office of Institutional Research &amp; Assessment (OIRA) department in your email account with the evaluation website link and your passcode.

We faculty work hard to do the best possible job when preparing and delivering courses for our students. Please understand that not only does the school use the course evaluations to make decisions about the curriculum to improve where necessary, but they also use them to make decisions about faculty members. Please take the time and fill out this evaluation as your feedback and support of this assessment effort is very much appreciated.

# Course Specific Policies
